## Installation:

Make sure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.  We have most recently tested these instructions with Node v22.2.0 and npm v10.7.0 on an x86-64 Mac (macOS Monterrey 12.7.4), as well as with Node v16.15.0 and npm v8.10.0 on an x86-64 Linux machine running Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS.  See [package.json] for detailed dependency information.

Clone this repository, `cd` into it, and run `npm install` to install the dependencies. Once installed, run `npm start` to spin up the dev server. Open a browser window to the URI `localhost:8000`, and watch it go. 

## Commands:

`$ npm start`

* Starts the development server
* Watches your code and rebuilds the app when a file changes
* Automatically compiles Less
* Prints a lint output to the console on save

`$ npm run build`

* transpiles the code into a dist folder
