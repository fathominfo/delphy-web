      <p>Surpassing existing Bayesian phylogenetic inference tools in speed and accessibility, Delphy allows researchers to immediately begin running and viewing their data with a simple FASTA file upload. Once sufficient samples have been generated, users can investigate their data by navigating the phylogeny of a summary tree, exploring and comparing mutations, and layering in their own metadata â€” all within Delphy. Data uploaded into Delphy is not sent to a remote server and information viewed within the tool will always remain secure, local, and fully within your control.</p>
      <p class="closing">The Delphy tool has been developed by Fathom Information Design in close collaboration with Patrick Varilly, Ph.D., of the Sabeti Lab at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT.</p>
